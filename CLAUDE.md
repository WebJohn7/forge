# CLAUDE.md

Forge — personal training tracker PWA for the user's iPhone. `README.md` covers what it does
and the deploy/install/notification setup. `plan.txt` is the agreed plan. This file covers how
the code is arranged and what must not break.

## Commands

```bash
npm test                   # node --test — the whole suite, zero dependencies
py -m http.server 8138     # local serve; `npx serve` redirects index.html, which breaks the SW cache
node tools/make-icons.mjs  # icons/*.png, pure Node
cd worker && npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir <tmp>   # check the Worker bundles
```

No build, no bundler, no `dependencies`. Hosted as static files on GitHub Pages.

## Module split — the load-bearing boundary

```
src/schedule.js   PURE  week template, due sessions, status (done/late/pending/overdue/missed), moves
src/penalties.js  PURE  miss → debt, payOldest, streak, discipline score
src/stats.js      PURE  e1RM, tonnage, adherence, pace, weight avg/trend
src/feedback.js   PURE  rules → ranked findings + weekly verdict (THRESHOLDS at top)
src/model.js      PURE  compute(): stored data → everything the screens show; pushState()
src/reminders.js  PURE  which push notifications are due now (used by the Worker only)
src/store.js      browser  IndexedDB + export/import
src/push.js       browser  subscribe + sync state to the Worker
src/app.js        browser  load, derive, route (#today #log #dash #history #settings), all mutations
src/ui/*.js       browser  one file per screen; charts.js = hand-rolled SVG charts
sw.js             offline shell (SHELL list) + push/notificationclick
worker/           Cloudflare Worker: index.js (routes + cron), webpush.js (VAPID + aes128gcm, WebCrypto only)
```

Pure modules import nothing browser-side and take `now` as an argument — keep new logic there
and test it in Node. The Worker imports `src/reminders.js` directly (wrangler bundles it).

## Invariants the tests assert

- Status is judged on `effectiveDate` (the Thursday a session was moved to, else its own date);
  grace ends 12:00 the next day. Misses are evaluated over every day since `startDate`, so not
  opening the app never dodges a miss.
- `newDebts` is idempotent (keyed by due id); the Sunday combo owes both gym and TKD penalties.
- The streak does not grow for sessions logged while any debt was open.
- Reminders fire at most once per key per day and never more than 60 min late.
- `sw.js` SHELL must list every browser module (a test checks). Bump `VERSION` when shell files change.
- Dark only. Chart colours follow the dataviz reference palette (dark steps); status colours
  (good / warning / critical) are reserved for status and always paired with a text label.
